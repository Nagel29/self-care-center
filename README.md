# Self-Care Center

### Abstract:
[//]: <> (Briefly describe what you built and its features. What problem is the app solving? How does this application solve that problem?)
This website allows the user to randomly display positive affirmations or mantras as messages upon clicking the Receive Message button. The user can also choose to add their own custom message which will then be displayed and saved to the data model for later use when receiving messages. Lastly, the user can delete messages in order to remove them from the data model entirely and never allow them to display again.

The problem that this app is solving is the need for users to receive positive messages. The app utilizes Javascript to pull messages from the stored arrays and then manipulate the DOM to display those messages for the user.

### Installation Instructions:

### Context:
[//]: <> (Give some context for the project here. How long did you have to work on it? How far into the Turing program are you?)
I am in week 3 of the Turing School of Software and Design course. This project took me a total of roughly 10 hours to complete.

### Contributors:
[//]: <> (Who worked on this application? Link to their GitHubs.)
I am the only contributor of this application: <a href="https://github.com/Nagel29">Ryan Nagel</a>

### Learning Goals:
[//]: <> (What were the learning goals of this project? What tech did you work with?)
* Gain experience building an application that utilizes HTML, CSS and JavaScript
* Write HTML and CSS to match a provided comp
* Understand how to listen to and respond to user events
* Individualize your programming skill set

### Wins + Challenges:
[//]: <> (What are 2-3 wins you have from this project? What were some challenges you faced - and how did you get over them?)
* Wins:
  - This is my first project that required me to build out my own HTML and CSS, which really helped solidify what I've learned with those languages thus far.
  - I was able to go beyond the minimum requirements of the project and successfully implement multiple extensions.
* Challenges:
  - I had no prior experience with using "flexbox" in CSS and it did take me some time to understand it. I was able to play around with <a href="https://flexboxfroggy.com/">Flexbox Froggy</a> and that gave me a basic understand of the concept.
